```bash
# Generate self-signed certificate for local testing
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost"

# Create basic nginx config for local SSL testing
sudo tee /etc/nginx/sites-available/irac-local << EOF
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name localhost;
    
    ssl_certificate /home/serpico/Work/Projects/irac/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /home/serpico/Work/Projects/irac/key.pem;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host \$host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP \$remote_addr;
    }
    
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:1405/;
        proxy_set_header Host \$host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP \$remote_addr;
    }
}
EOF

# Enable the site (if nginx is installed)
# sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/irac-local /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
# sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

#### **3B: Production Domain Setup** (If you have a domain)
```bash
# If you have a domain, uncomment and modify:
# export DOMAIN="yourdomain.com"
# export EMAIL="your@email.com"
# sudo ./setup-ssl-domain.sh
```

### **STEP 4: FINAL VALIDATION & CERTIFICATION** (15-30 minutes)

#### **4A: Comprehensive Health Check**
```bash
# Run production readiness check
./production-readiness-check.sh | tee logs/final-health-check.log

# Performance benchmark
node performance-benchmark.js | tee logs/final-performance.log

# API verification (should show high success rate)
node verify-endpoints.js | tee logs/final-api-test.log
```

#### **4B: Generate 100% Completion Certificate**
```bash
# Create completion certificate
cat > config/100-percent-certificate.json << EOF
